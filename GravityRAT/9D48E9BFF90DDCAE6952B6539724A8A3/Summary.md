# Summary
GravityRAT spyware is a targeted APT used to target the Indian Army Forces, comes with many versions from Android to Electron, `Python` and `.NET` Binaries. Masquerading as Legitimate Apps, this strain hides behind a Chat App mask.


# Execution
- The 1st payload comes as an installer unpacks by initiating a new _unpakced_ instance of itself in it's memory space.
- The 2nd stage payload `Chat2HireBootstrap.exe` will perform installation tasks as well as maintaining persistence on the system by adding a `RunOnce` registry key value.

- The Final payload will perform its targeted nefarious tasks only if the Victim machine belongs to a certain group.
- Some of its recon jobs is by enumerating the `Language Settings`, `timezones` ...etc
- an example of a C2 communication is sending results of system information gathering via `HTTP-POST` requests to the Command and Control Server.
- It will utilize `WMI` to recon the victim environment
